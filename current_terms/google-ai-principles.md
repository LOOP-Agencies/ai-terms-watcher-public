Our AI Principles in action Our AI Principles guide the development and deployment of our AI systems. These Principles inform our frameworks and policies, such as the Secure AI Framework for security and privacy, and the Frontier Safety Framework for evolving model capabilities. Our governance process covers model development, application deployment, and post-launch monitoring. We identify and assess AI risks through research, external expert input, and red teaming. We then evaluate our systems against safety, privacy, and security benchmarks. Finally, we build mitigations with techniques such as safety tuning, security controls, and robust provenance solutions.
