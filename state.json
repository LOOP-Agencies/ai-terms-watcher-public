Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. 1. Agreement to Arbitrate. This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the \"Arbitration Agreement.\" You and Stability agree that any and all disputes, claims, demands, or causes of action (\"Claims\") that have arisen or may arise between you and us, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Site, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator, rather than in a court by a judge or jury, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you or we may (but are not required to) assert individual Claims in small claims court if such Claims are within the scope of such court's jurisdiction. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action and that our respective rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. 2. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualised Relief. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. 3. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Before commencing any arbitration (or suit in small claims court, if available), you agree to provide Stability with a written notice of Claim, and Stability agrees to provide you with a written notice of Claim to the extent reasonably possible based on the availability of your contact information to Stability (\"Notice\"). The Notice to Stability shall be sent to legal@stability.ai with a paper copy to c/o Legal, Fora - United House, 9 Pembridge Rd., London, W11 3JY, UK. Where Stability has your contact information, Stability will send its Notice to you using the last email address we have on file for you if you have provided us with an email address (each, a \"Notice Address\"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the Claim in sufficient detail to evaluate the merits of the claiming party's Claim and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought, including the amount of money (if any) that is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed amount. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a Claim through informal negotiation within sixty (60) calendar days of receiving the Notice. If the Claim is not resolved within sixty (60) calendar days after receiving the Notice, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. Each party agrees that state and federal courts in New York, New York, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph. 4. Arbitration Procedures. The Federal Arbitration Act fully applies to the Arbitration Agreement. A neutral arbitrator will conduct the arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's (\"AAA\") Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time that such arbitration is initiated (collectively, the \"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found on the AAA's consumer arbitration page: http://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms will be controlled. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. Except as set forth above, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, threshold issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement and issues relating to (a) whether the terms of these Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable, or illusory and (b) any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. During arbitration proceedings, the amount of any settlement offer made by Stability or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party's Claim. The arbitrator's decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedent or collateral estoppel effect on any other Claim. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Any arbitration hearings will occur in New York, New York, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or video conference. Whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator or by a hearing will be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. 5. Small Claims Court. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Claim in a local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in a small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis. 6. Cost of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \"Arbitration Fees\") will be governed by the AAA Rules unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator's satisfaction that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, we will pay your portion of such fees, subject to allocation in the arbitrator's award. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The AAA Rules will govern any payment of attorneys' fees. 7. Confidentiality. Each of the parties shall maintain the strictly confidential nature of the arbitration, including all aspects of the arbitration proceeding and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other results of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by law. 8. Opt-Out. You may reject this Arbitration Agreement, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any Claim. To reject this provision, you must send us an opt-out notice (the \"Opt-Out\") within thirty (30) days after you first access the Site. The Opt-Out must be sent to the Stability Notice Address. The Opt-Out must include your name, phone number and the email address you used to sign up and use the Site. This is the only way of opting out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out will not affect any other aspect of these Terms and will not affect any other or future agreements you may reach to arbitrate with us. 9. Severability. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than Paragraph 2) above titled \"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualised Relief\" is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable, and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of Paragraph 2 above, titled \"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualised Relief,\" are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to Claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply. Choice of Law Any and all Claims shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the internal substantive laws of the State of New York in all respects, without regard for the jurisdiction or forum in which the user is domiciled, resides or located at the time of such access or use. Except as provided in the Arbitration Agreement, all Claims will be brought in the federal or state courts in New York, New York, and you and Stability each unconditionally, voluntarily, and irrevocably consent to those courts' exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue. YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, AS SET FORTH ABOVE. A printed version of these Terms and any other notice given in electronic form will be admissible in any arbitral, judicial, or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms and your use of the Site to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Waiver and Severability If you do not comply with a portion of these Terms and we do not take action immediately, this does not mean we are giving up any of our rights under these Terms. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator, the remainder of the Terms shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. Entire Agreement; Construction These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and Stability regarding your use of the Site and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings between you and Stability on that subject. Assignment and Delegation You may not assign or delegate these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms. Any attempted or purported attempted assignment or delegation shall be null and void and will automatically terminate your right to use the Site. We may assign or delegate these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets to any affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization. Notices Unless otherwise specified, all notices to Stability under these Terms shall be sent to legal@stability.ai. Service of any notice will be deemed given on the date of receipt delivered by email. Changes to these Terms We may change or modify these Terms by posting a revised version on the Site or by otherwise providing notice to you, and we will state at the top of the revised Terms the date they were last revised. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) calendar days after they are posted, except for changes addressing changes made for legal reasons, which will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Site after any change means you agree to the new Terms."
